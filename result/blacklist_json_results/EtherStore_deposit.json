      "description": "## Reentrancy \n\n ### Definition : \n- Reentrancy is a vulnerability that allows a function to repeatedly call another function within a contract before completing the previous execution.\n- This typically occurs when an internal contract calls an external contract. \n\n ### example : \n- When contract A calls contract B, B's code is executed.\n- If contract B then calls a function within contract A, it permits reentry, potentially leading to changes in A's state.\n- Reentrancy is particularly risky in financial operations.\n- If contract A sends ether to contract B and B subsequently calls a function in A to return the ether, A may process the funds within B's function, creating an opportunity for an attacker to repeatedly siphon off ether.\n\n### Prevention :\n- To prevent Reentrancy vulnerabilities, it's essential to modify the state before making external calls or employ locking mechanisms when necessary to thwart attacks and enhance security."
