## Background:


<details> 
    <summary style='font-size: 18px;color:pink;'> üí° What is Inline Assembly? </summary><br />
    
`inline-assembly` allows for direct interaction with the EVM, providing a level of control and precision that is not achievable at a high-level.

Specifically, it enables you to adjust gas usage and access specific EVM features. In Solidity, you can write `inline-assembly` using the intermediate language Yul, which is designed to compile into EVM bytecode. 

It is written in the following form:

```solidity
assembly{ ... }
```

## Description:


Typically, the Solidity compiler performs checks to ensure that memory is well-defined and safe. However, when using `inline-assembly`, you can bypass the compiler's checks, potentially leading to memory manipulation.


<br />

## Recommendation:

Be cautious when using `inline assembly.`

<br />

## Exploit scenario:


```solidity
contract VulnerableContract {
    uint8 public balance;

    function deposit(uint8 amount) public {
        assembly {
            sstore(balance.slot, add(sload(balance.slot), amount))
        }
    }

    function withdraw(uint8 amount) public {
        require(amount <= balance, "Insufficient balance");
        assembly {
            sstore(balance.slot, sub(sload(balance.slot), amount))
        }
    }
}
```


In the `deposit` function, the `add` assembly instruction is used to add `amount` to the `balance`. 
If the `balance` is close to its maximum value, such as 255, an overflow can occur when attempting to add more, causing the `balance` to wrap around unexpectedly and decrease.
