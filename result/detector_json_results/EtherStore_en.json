Using Randomness from the Blockchain Network Nodes </summary><br />\n\nBlockchain networks provide certain variables in each block, such as \n   \n|  |  |  |\n---|---|---\n`block.basefee(uint)`|`block.chainid(uint)`|`block.coinbase()`\n`block.difficulty(uint)`|`block.gaslimit(uint)`|`block.number(uint)`\n`block.timestamp(uint)`|`blockhash(uint)` \n\n   \nAmong these, `block.difficulty`, `blockhash`, `block.number`, and `block.timestamp` are commonly used for random number generation.\n\n\n[Solidity Docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/units-and-global-variables.html#block-and-transaction-properties \"Reference\")\n\nRandomness generated based on block data can limit the ability of typical users to predict the random numbers, but malicious miners can potentially manipulate block data to influence the generated randomness. \n\nBlock data remains the same for a given block, meaning that generating randomness from the same block will always produce the same result.\n</details>\n<br />\n\n<details> \n    <summary style='font-size: 16px;color:skyblue;'> 2. Using External Random Number Generators </summary><br />\n\n   Blockchain oracles can be used to generate random number seeds, and off-chain data can be obtained on-chain using on-chain oracles. \n   External randomness sources, such as API data, can be fetched and used to influence contract behavior. \n   \n   This can increase unpredictability compared to generating randomness using blockchain variables, but it may introduce trust issues related to the oracle's reliability.\n</details>\n<br />\n    ",
